# SunEarthVolumeProject

This project calculates the volume of the Earth and the Sun and determines the ratio of the Sun's volume to the Earth's volume.

## Instructions

1. The diameter of the Earth is approximately 7,600 miles.
2. The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,000 miles.
3. Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, the program calculates the volume of both celestial bodies.

## Formula
The volume of a sphere is given by:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where:
- `r` is the radius of the sphere.
