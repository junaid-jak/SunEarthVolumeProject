# SunEarthVolumeProject

This project calculates the volume of the Earth and the Sun and determines the ratio of the Sun's volume to the Earth's volume.

## Instructions

1. The diameter of the Earth is approximately 7,600 miles.
2. The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,000 miles.
3. Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, the program calculates the volume of both celestial bodies.

## Formula
The volume of a sphere is given by:
V=4/3 PI r3
where:
- `r` is the radius of the sphere.
## Output
The volume of the Earth is 2.2984729611703882E11 cubic miles.
The volume of the Sun is 3.388807851993121E17 cubic miles.
The ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth is 1474373.5990122468.
